                    <p class="text_desc">The main task was to understand all the processes of the company, identify strengths and weaknesses (bottle necks), as well as to automate all the processes. The specifics of the company's work implied the presence of many partner companies at each stage of the parcel's journey, as well as a large number of procedures related to the exchange of information with the customs systems of different countries. Despite the large number of such systems on the market, the specifics of working with Ukraine led to the client's decision to make the system, sharpened exclusively for the needs of his company. An important aspect of the system is its internationality, as well as the ability to work comfortably in countries with slow Internet connections. For the company's management it was very important to get information about the main indicators of the company and through extraordinary situations in real time to have a complete picture of what is happening.</p>

                <div class="project_text-blue">
                    <p class="text_title">The solution</p>
                    <p class="text_desc">After a detailed study of all business processes, an ERP-system was developed, which features modularity and flexibility in terms of connecting different customs API and API of partner companies. The system was created taking into account the fact that the company's employees have different level of experience with PCs, speak different languages and are responsible for individual processes. All processes in the company are now unified and conducted through one system, regardless of the country, language and speed of the Internet. The system is also synchronized with the website and personal cabinet for the company's clients, which allows to automatically receive and place orders, notify clients about promotions, goods arrived and changes in the company's operations.</p>
