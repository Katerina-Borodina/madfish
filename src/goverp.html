                    <p class="text_desc">We had to understand all the processes of the company, identify strengths and weaknesses (bottle necks), as well as automate all the processes, while making them more transparent and efficient. It was important to merge all the departments into one coherent structure that could react quickly to changes. And to give management the opportunity to get all the necessary information in real time, which would allow them to make decisions faster and more accurately. Also an important part of the task was to make a system that could be easily understood by the user of any level of PC use. An additional complication was the fact that the company had many branches in different cities of the country, which had to constantly coordinate their activities with the central office.</p>

                <div class="project_text-blue">
                    <p class="text_title">The solution</p>
                    <p class="text_desc">After a detailed study of all processes and their bottlenecks, the peculiarities of each employee of the company, as well as detailed collection of requirements from management, an ERP-system was developed, covering all tasks related to the company's operation, as well as synchronization with the accounting system and the resource for data exchange with customers. Employees of the company refused from all additional software, except for professional engineering programs. All communication with customers and employees, document flow, reporting, file storage, analytics, postal services, as well as order value calculations were combined into one system and became maximally optimized for the activity of a particular company.
                        When using the new system - the speed of order processing increased by 17%, and was almost completely eliminated one of the departments of the company, engaged in the execution of standard documents.</p>
