         ...In twenty first century dusty books and messy tones of papers are going much further in history, people started literally forgetting about such kind of documentation. Furthermore, youngsters are searching the best way to get rid of all those bureaucracy burdens. That’s why was made such things as Agile. Many would say that computer documentation has no place nowadays and in general there’s no need in making documentation and tracking it throughout long process of creating new product, but requirements to eligibility and clearness doing business had changed a lot. Right now companies may show their flexibility, intelligence and high professionalism by actually doing some documentation during process. Why not before, you may ask? Because in such temp of life none leader will know for sure what’s going to happen next, so recording each change and creation is as expedient as never before. 
In modern language it is important to document not only functional requirements but also non-functional ones, such as performance and failure requirements and other non-functional requirements. In particular, the language should be sufficiently simplified to further accelerate the work in the event of a change in the building link in the team
As a rule, such documents are written as user stories, and their content and completeness may change during project development. This makes it as easy as possible to implement and modify any elements in the product development process.
The so-called archi

tectural documentation is used to create and track top-level decisions regarding branching and system behavior. At this stage, documentation of all the above requirements is important: timeliness, simplicity, relevance, truthfulness. Architectural and design documentation may include frame diagrams, user interface sketches, topology descriptions, inspection testing plans, and even class structure.
There is also technical documentation that records the code. Note this kind of documentation is not widely known in the world and in general, and therefore used only by internal users of the management. Such documentation includes API descriptions, environment variable lists, ReadMe files, and code comments. It is difficult for average user to imagine the difficulty of writing such documentation, since there are many complications in the self-documentation code creating. You can use specific automatic tools like Swagger or Javadoc by entering the required documentation time, which is convenient enough for those who are trying to save their time, but on the other hand are able to generate such easy code and therefore documentation that this action will help in the future greatly facilitate the work process.
However, unit tests will be used as a code specification, which will greatly simplify support for further changes in the long term.
Therefore, the importance of end-user documentation is to acquire a form of instructions, manuals, etc. It is worth noting that sometimes the documentation is not end-user focused but purely B2B, however, even for such a targeting group, the instructions and some explanations will be clear enough. There is no doubt that the software is really only useful when it is used only by an experienced user, and a good set of instructions and helps users to reach this level.
In particular, such documentation can be considered as a marketing move, which undoubtedly will attract the attention of professionals in their field. Even in the absence of a full-fledged advertising campaign, a company can use codes and steps to create a product to explain the benefits, in fact, of its product to already advanced users.
It should be noted that such documentation methods are extremely easy to live and play a positive role in the programming world. Facilitating processes and winning over competitors is the main goal of many businesses, and in this case, such relief and exemption from paper bureaucracy makes life easier for both developers and end buyers.
