        <p class="paragraph">
          Nowadays we may see, how important design is. More and more, both
          sharks of business world and small start ups trying to involve their
          costumer thanks to designing. Still, many designers don’t know the
          perfect way of working with different systems that’s why this list may
          be amazingly useful for those, who is interested in high-quality
          product.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">Design as a A class fuel for project</h1>

        <p class="paragraph">
          At first glance benefits of creating a design system are obvious and
          clear. It’s pretty easy to connect a design system to cost savings,
          scalability, efficiency, and consistency. Somehow, even seeing such
          benefits from design systems, many, fail to provide necessary
          resources for a successful system. Most likely it happens because
          teams feel pressure while launching some features, and those
          resources, spent on the design system, shall decrease velocity on the
          product that pays the bills. If you really want to make savings thanks
          to a design system then it can not be treated as an secondary
          something, not like just useless background. As the company grew, and
          teams began developing product, future customers ask for concrete UI
          themes, and, basically, thats how new product lines were born. From
          the start the design system was looked as a saving favor, it drives
          across these new teams and products, and allows to quickly theme our
          UI. And soon leaders understood that without devoted developers, the
          design system would never become something more than sketches of
          symbols. For those, who thinks about design system only as about many
          symbols, must be explained that it has its own unique set of end
          users, who have their own unique problems and contexts of use. Each
          step crave pensive systems and capable guidance between stakeholders.
          For a design system to be successful, there's a rule -- you must have
          a team whose only job is to work only on it.
        </p>

        <h1 class="subtitle">The way to successes is team</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
          The easiest way to build system is if you have support from the people
          who are sitting in expensive chairs in offices. But the hardest part
          is to get your c-level team to ideal of idea, especially because of
          given resources, needed to build a helpful and pracious design system.
          All you need to get started on that kind of a design system is one
          designer and one developer who are passionate enough to work, improve
          and work again.
        </p>
        <h1 class="subtitle">
          Work with team as a good leader not selfish boss
        </h1>
        <p class="paragraph">
          ...As stated above, there is an obvious benefit to the design system,
          but even picking up the right one, the team does not always want to
          use it. Some of the designers may have formed some behavior earlier
          and used the opposite design systems before, so expect that the
          pressure through the "in-house tool" will not flow successfully and
          may even impair the performance of the future product. The design
          system should not only add value to the company, but also simplify
          lives of the people who do the work. Otherwise, the team will copy
          inconsistent elements from random corners of one product, create
          incomprehensible designs, complicate the array of one design system
          with another. To facilitate the work of the team, it is necessary to
          involve it in the construction of the design system. It is advisable
          to talk to each project creator and find out which systems they have
          used before, or how their experience will help in creating a new one.
          The workflow of the team should be understood. After that, the work
          will begin to go on its own with completely smaller and simpler
          problems. Just because the design system is primarily an internal tool
          it doesn't mean that you do not have to confirm it. A design system is
          completive archive of various data so don't mess up with it Although
          many design systems show a whole library of UI components and branding
          guidelines, a true design system includes so much more. In case of an
          absence of integration of design system with the products it supports,
          then its value becomes severely limited. Many teams are trying to
          create an upgrade of design so that changes may apply to all products,
          including the library of items. However, thi s is completely
          impossible for now, and then you have to make manual adjustments. Yes,
          in the case of a widespread element change in the product, again, it
          is necessary to check the integrity of all layouts. Some changes may
          be accidental, or involuntarily missed items. The design system should
          outline a clear process for introducing new components and models to
          change existing ones. And this process must match the size, culture
          and maturity of your business. Small teams can get along with
          unofficial, impromptu weakened messages, while larger teams may need
          official reviews and change requests. Use new components and new ways
          of doing things Once your design system will reach the point which
          will look like a critical mass with a large enough amount of
          components possibly satisfying to solve most, if not all, design
          problems. At the same time, design systems make reusable
          components too readily accessible. One design teams can use or imitate
          existing components without solving how a new component might work on
          the design problem. Teams also tend to overplay the importance of
          usage of a basic easier solution because it is similar to an existing
          pattern which most probably was used before, and not for once.
          Designers must constantly ask themselves if a new component will be
          able to solve the problem better — whether we are okay with
          simply satisfying the users’ needs. To become one of the best in A
          list company must developing without stop, delighting users in ways
          that competitors can't. Don't make empty discussions, system always
          works The hardest thing is to convince people to adopt your design
          system. But at the same time for some systems, the biggest challenge
          is to get stakeholders to consensus on design principles and how
          components work.Often teams tend to overthink how a component should
          function, creating unbelievable and useless scenarios. Worst part is
          clinging to small parts of work that suppose to be thought almost in
          the end of any project. Spending time on unplanned steps will decline
          productivity of each doer and stakeholder and financial looses as
          well. The main point of a design system is to make difficult
          components easier, simplified. So instead of having too many
          conversations about a hypothetical future, making new hard components,
          remind everyone that you can talk and discuss the design system any
          other time.Choose the responsible person for project management Do not
          expect that each member of your team will be perfectly aware and
          remember about their accurate role in the project, so it’s best to
          appoint a responsible person who perfectly knows about each change and
          new idea, will constantly remind and motivate doer to take the right
          actions. Do not be afraid that design might start changing, because an
          important element of each design is the synergy between each from
          stuff who involved in project. In ideal, you should make "change
          notification”, about which the responsible designer will know and be
          able to explain new tasks and manage the project with adjustments.
          Make from novice professionals When hiring new employees, don't think
          that they have necessarily worked in any design system. Not to spoil
          all the further work, better to let the freshers importance of their
          being in current position, and after that YOU, having got a perfectly
          adapted to your style of work professional, shall only see the
          incredible advantages of this process. Do not be afraid to type in a
          professional vocabulary and create it in the workplace and staple of
          everyday communication, as this will most likely lead to quick
          understanding and better work. A nice bonus will be an improvement of
          professional skills and work experience. Make curves not flatness
          Although design systems are newsworthy, we should warn you! In case if
          you are small company with less than five products and a little
          costumers, then you’d better to wait for development and only after
          start creating design systems. Big companies are most likely to get
          more benefits from designing, for small it is inappropriate. Design
          systems suppose to make everyt hing easier so there’s no meaning to
          simplify already onefold things. ...
